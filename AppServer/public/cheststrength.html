                    <li> Pectoralis major: The main muscle associated with the chest, the pectoralis major is the large
                        muscle you can see from the outside. Its main action is to bring the arms closer to the body,
                        but it also assists with moving the shoulders and rotating the arms. The pectoralis major is the
                        biggest and strongest—and therefore the most important—of the chest muscles.</li>
                    <li>Pectoralis minor: Situated beneath the pectoralis major to assist in key functions, the
                        pectoralis minor is an important chest muscle, but also a problematic one. It is integral to
                        shoulder movement, especially shoulder rotation. Situated in a sensitive area near the rib cage,
                        the pectoralis minor is prone to painful tightness, which can disrupt posture.</li>

                        the clavicle bone when we breathe in. But because it’s situated in a place where some people
                        hold tension, the subclavius is prone to tightness.</li>

                            A bench press is an exercise that can be used to strengthen the muscles of the upper body,
                            including the pectorals, arms, and shoulders. Depending on your goals, there are different
                            variations of bench presses that work slightly different muscles, too. For example, a
                            narrower grip bench press will put extra emphasis on the triceps and forearms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other benefits of adding bench presses to your weight-training regimen include increasing
                            upper body strength, improving muscular endurance, and even preparing your upper body to do
                            movements like pushups. They also can be an effective strengthening exercise for sports like
                            sprinting, hockey, and football.</p>

                                The purpose of the incline press is to focus more of the work on the upper pecs. The main benefit in performing incline presses is to develop the upper portion of the pectoral muscles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the bench is set at an incline (15 to 30 degrees), you activate your shoulders more since it’s comparable to a shoulder press. Also, because of the angle of the bench, this exercise puts less stress on your rotator cuff, which is a common area for injury when using the flat bench.

                                    The art of the dumbbell press is a conscientious blend of strength, control, and
                                    technique making this exercise effective and efficient. You can perform the dumbbell
                                    press on a flat bench, incline, or standing upright. Dumbbell presses are an
                                    essential staple of resistance training offering various benefits to both novices
                                    and advanced athletes.
                                </p>

                                    At its core, the dumbbell press activates multiple muscle groups. The main target is
                                    the pectorals in the chest press. Deltoids are the primary target and a shoulder
                                    press. This compound movement engages the triceps, the rhomboids, and the serratus
                                    anterior. Its engagement across multiple muscles makes the dumbbell press an
                                    efficient and effective strength-building exercise. This exercise improves muscle
                                    mass and upper body power when you train consistently over time.

                                        Dips are a type of strength training exercise that require you to lift your body weight with your triceps, deltoids, pecs, and rhomboid muscles. One type you can do is a bench dip, where you support your body weight from behind. For a tricep dip, use parallel bars to lift yourself up and down. If you can't dip your full body weight yet, don't worry. Most gyms have a machine that can provide assistance for dips so you don't have to support your whole body weight. Aim to do strength training exercises like these 2-3 times a week.</p>
