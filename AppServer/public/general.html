                    Exercise is key to managing weight by burning calories, with more intense activities leading to
                    greater calorie burn. Even small changes like taking the stairs or increasing daily movement can
                    help. Consistent physical activity also lowers the risk of various health conditions, such as heart
                    disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes, by improving cholesterol levels and promoting
                    better circulation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond physical health, exercise enhances mood, energy, and sleep quality. It releases brain
                    chemicals that reduce stress, improve confidence, and boost self-esteem. Regular activity
                    strengthens muscles, increases endurance, and helps you sleep better. Additionally, it can improve
                    your sex life and offer fun, social opportunities, making it an essential part of a healthy
                    lifestyle.</p>

                    There are multiple workout splits the average person can follow. A reminder is that all of these
                    splits
                    should be conducted with exercises that promote strength, endurance, and possibly hypertrophy in the
                    muscles. Here are some examples like the ones we provided in other sections:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Push; Pull; Legs/Abs - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any order), with at
                    least one day of rest in between every cycle.</p>
                <p>
                    Chest/Biceps/Triceps; Back/Forearms/Shoulders; Legs/Abs - These days should follow each other
                    concurrently (in any order), with at least one day of rest in between every cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chest; Back; Arms; Legs; Abs (Bro Split) - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any
                    order), with at least one day of rest in between every cycle.

        <li>Body Composition</li>
        <div class="ListFlexProgram">
            <div class="programImg" id="generalComp">
                <img src="GeneralComp.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="TextProgram" id="generalCompText">
                <p>
                    For a normal healthy person, the ideal body composition focuses on maintaining a balance between
                    lean muscle mass and a moderate body fat percentage to support overall health and daily
                    functionality. For men, a healthy body fat percentage typically ranges from 10% to 20%, while for
                    women, it usually falls between 18% and 28%. This range supports general health, reduces the risk of
                    chronic diseases, and allows for optimal energy levels and physical performance in everyday
                    activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maintaining lean muscle mass is important for metabolic health, strength, and mobility. Regular
                    strength training and physical activity help preserve muscle mass, support joint health, and improve
                    overall fitness. Prioritizing a variety of nutrients also contributes to better immunity, mental
                    well-being, and long-term health. This balanced approach to body composition helps individuals
                    maintain a healthy lifestyle and enhance their quality of life.

        <div class="ListFlexProgram">
            <div class="programImg" id="Pros">
                <img src="Pros.png" alt="">

                <p>
                    A healthy lifestyle helps prevent disease by reducing the risk of conditions like cardiovascular
                    disease, type 2 diabetes, and early death. Studies show that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and
                    whole grains, combined with regular physical activity, can significantly lower these risks. Even
                    small increases in daily exercise or dietary improvements can have a notable impact on health
                    outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, maintaining good health can save money by reducing the need for frequent doctor
                    visits, medications, and treatments. Regular check-ups help catch potential issues early, improving
                    outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Healthy habits like avoiding smoking, staying active, and
                    eating well not only extend lifespan but also benefit the environment by reducing the demand for
                    ultra-processed foods and lowering carbon emissions through sustainable practices like biking
                    instead of driving. The best part: there is no downside!</p>
