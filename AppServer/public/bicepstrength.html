                        (shoulder blade). It contributes to elbow flexion and assists with shoulder stability during arm
                        movements.</li>
                    <li> Long Head: The long head begins at the supraglenoid tubercle, a small bump just above the

                        stabilize the shoulder during overhead motions</li>

                            Hammer curls, also known as dumbbell hammer curls or neutral grip dumbbell curls, is a
                            strength training exercise that specifically targets your biceps and your forearms. A hammer
                            curl varies from a traditional bicep curl because you use a neutral grip with your palms
                            facing each other during the full range of motion.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            This neutral grip shifts some of the focus onto the brachialis, a muscle underneath the
                            biceps, and the brachioradialis, a prominent forearm muscle, contributing to greater overall
                            arm strength and size. Hammer curls are particularly beneficial for enhancing grip strength
                            and improving the functionality of the arms for daily activities and athletic performance.
                            They are a versatile exercise, suitable for beginners and advanced lifters, and can be
                            performed with dumbbells, resistance bands, or a cable machine to add variety to your
                            workout routine.</p>

                                The incline bicep curl trains the biceps behind the body, creating a greater range of
                                motion than the standard bicep curl and putting more emphasis on the long head of the
                                bicep. The incline bicep curl uses an incline bench and requires the performer to sit
                                down and extend the arms so that they hang behind the body. Keeping the upper body,
                                shoulders and upper arms in a strict position, the biceps are challenged to raise the
                                dumbbells to shoulder height and back down again.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                By having the load behind the body, it may feel as though the beginning of the exercise
                                is the most challenging, however the most difficult portion is during the mid-range. The
                                use of the incline bench further allows for the muscles to be trained through a greater
                                range of motion and the varying angle makes for a well-rounded bicep regime.

                                    The bicep curl is a foundational exercise that targets the biceps, helping to build
                                    strength and definition in the upper arm. This versatile movement can be performed
                                    with dumbbells, barbells, resistance bands, or cables, making it accessible to all
                                    fitness levels.
                                </p>

                                    Bicep curls are highly effective for building strength, as they allow you to focus
                                    on progressively overloading the biceps by increasing the resistance over time. By
                                    challenging the muscle with heavier weights while maintaining proper form, you can
                                    improve overall arm strength and functionality. Strength-focused bicep curls also
                                    help stabilize your elbows and enhance your ability to perform pulling movements in
                                    other exercises, such as rows, chin-ups, and deadlifts.
