                <p>
                    Strongman is a weightlifting-based sport where athletes compete in a series of events that test
                    various aspects of mental and physical strength, speed, and endurance. The wide range of events
                    allows the sport to accommodate athletes of different body types and skill sets. Some competitions
                    prioritize sheer size and raw power, with extremely heavy weights, while others focus on endurance
                    and agility, requiring competitors to move moderately heavy loads over a set distance or within a
                    time limit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In many well-balanced competitions, success depends on a combination of strength, speed, and overall
                    physical conditioning, making it a versatile and dynamic sport. Strongman athletes must not only be
                    able to lift massive weights but also demonstrate exceptional mobility, endurance, and mental
                    toughness, adapting to the diverse challenges each competition presents.</p>

                    There are multiple workout splits a strongman can follow. A reminder is that all of these splits
                    should be conducted with exercises that promote strength and endurance in the muscles. Here are some
                    examples:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Push; Pull; Legs/Abs - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any order), with at
                    least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.</p>
                <p>
                    Chest/Biceps/Triceps; Back/Forearms/Shoulders; Legs/Abs - These days should follow each other
                    concurrently (in any order), with at least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chest; Back; Arms; Legs; Abs (Bro Split) - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any
                    order), with at least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.

        <li>Body Composition</li>

            <div class="programImg">
                <img src="https://preview.redd.it/69-strongman-hafthor-bjornsson-also-known-as-the-mountain-v0-xgr384ciftac1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=5c9e0c455f8eaba474db2b2b76a9c25083dbdeae"

                <p>
                    For strongmen, the ideal body composition emphasizes strength and power over aesthetics, with a
                    focus on maximizing muscle mass and functional performance. Strongmen typically have higher body fat
                    percentages than bodybuilders, as extra weight can provide a mechanical advantage in lifting heavy
                    loads. Male strongmen usually maintain a body fat percentage of around 15% to 25%, while female
                    strongwomen may range from 20% to 30%. This additional body fat helps with stability, endurance, and
                    overall strength during events like deadlifts, overhead presses, and carrying heavy objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muscle mass is critical for strongman performance, but itâ€™s more about functional muscle than sheer
                    size. Strongmen prioritize heavy, compound lifts, often using lower rep ranges to increase maximal
                    strength. Nutrition plays a key role, with a focus on high-calorie, protein-rich meals to fuel
                    intense training and promote recovery. A well-balanced diet that includes ample carbohydrates, fats,
                    and proteins helps maintain the energy needed for both training and competition. Strongman athletes
                    thrive on a balance of mass, strength, and power, using their body composition to excel in
                    strength-based challenges.</p>

                <p>
                    Strongman training offers a variety of benefits, including weight loss, improved cardiovascular
                    fitness, increased muscle mass, and enhanced functional strength. Functional strength refers to the
                    ability to move heavy or awkward objects in real-world scenarios, a central focus of strongman
                    training. This also requires conditioning, as being strong without stamina limits the effectiveness
                    of the strength gained. Strongman exercises often involve lifting, carrying, and pulling heavy
                    loads, helping to develop not just strength but also endurance and mobility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, strongman training helps overcome plateaus by introducing new and unfamiliar movements
                    that stimulate further progress. It promotes muscle growth and bone density by keeping muscles under
                    tension for extended periods, which is especially beneficial for the elderly. Key exercises also
                    target trunk and grip strength, crucial for stability and daily tasks. Activities like sled pulls
                    challenge cardiovascular fitness by forcing the body to deliver oxygen and blood to large muscle
                    groups over long distances, boosting endurance and overall fitness.</p>

        <li>Cons</li>
        <div class="ListFlexProgram">
            <div class="programImg" id="Cons">
                <img src="BodyCons.png" alt="">

            <div class="TextProgram" id="strongmanConsProgram">
                <p>
                    While strongman training offers numerous benefits, there are also potential health risks to
                    consider. The heavy lifting and high-intensity nature of the sport can increase the risk of injury,
                    particularly to the joints, tendons, and ligaments. Overuse injuries, such as strains or sprains,
                    are common due to the repetitive, high-load movements involved. Additionally, the extreme stress
                    placed on the body during intense events can lead to overtraining, which may cause fatigue,
                    decreased performance, and increased susceptibility to illness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another consideration is the potential for cardiovascular strain, particularly in novice athletes
                    who are not accustomed to the intense physical demands of strongman training. The high-impact
                    movements and heavy lifting can put undue stress on the heart, especially for those with
                    pre-existing heart conditions. Furthermore, the focus on maximizing strength and muscle mass can
                    lead to an imbalance in overall fitness, neglecting other important aspects of health, such as
                    flexibility and aerobic conditioning. Proper technique, adequate rest, and balanced training are
                    essential to minimizing these risks.</p>
