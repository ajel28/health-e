                    Running is the action or movement of propelling yourself forward rapidly on foot. It’s different
                    from walking because when you walk, one foot is always on the ground. But with running, there’s a
                    moment when both feet are off the ground. That’s what makes running a high-impact activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the type of running you’re doing, it can be aerobic exercise, anaerobic exercise, or a
                    combination of both. Aerobic and anaerobic exercise are the two subtypes of cardiovascular exercise.
                    During aerobic exercise, oxygen intake and heart rate stay consistent over a period of time, whereas
                    anaerobic exercise involves quick bursts of energy performed at your highest level of effort for a
                    short time.</p>

                    Running requires a more specific split that caters specifically to the sport. A reminder is that all
                    of these splits
                    should be conducted with exercises that promote endurance in the muscles. Here is one example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Legs/Abs; Upper Body; Plyometrics - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any order),
                    with at
                    least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.</p>

        <li>Body Composition</li>
        <div class="ListFlexProgram">
            <div class="programImg" id="boltimg">
                <img src="img/Bolt.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="TextProgram" id="boltProgram">
                <p>
                    For runners, the ideal body composition focuses on a balance between lean muscle mass and low body
                    fat to optimize endurance, speed, and efficiency. Male runners often aim for a body fat percentage
                    between 6% and 15%, while female runners typically range from 12% to 20%. This leaner composition
                    helps reduce excess weight, allowing for more efficient movement and better endurance over long
                    distances. Maintaining a lower body fat percentage also contributes to improved oxygen efficiency,
                    crucial for sustaining performance in races and long training sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muscle mass is essential for runners, but the focus is on lean, functional muscle that supports
                    endurance and minimizes unnecessary bulk. Strength training complements running by enhancing muscle
                    stability, power, and injury prevention, particularly in the core and lower body. Nutrition is key,
                    with an emphasis on carbohydrates for energy, proteins for muscle repair, and fats for sustained
                    energy. A well-rounded diet ensures runners have the necessary fuel for training, recovery, and
                    competition, helping them achieve peak performance while maintaining an ideal body composition for
                    their sport.</p>

                    Running offers numerous health benefits, particularly for cardiovascular health. Just 10 minutes of
                    daily running can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, halving the chances of
                    dying from heart-related issues. It also lowers resting heart rate, indicating improved heart
                    efficiency and overall fitness. Beyond heart health, running enhances sleep quality, though it’s
                    best to avoid running late in the day as it may interfere with sleep due to the endorphin release
                    that boosts alertness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to cardiovascular and sleep benefits, running supports joint and back health, with
                    studies showing lower arthritis rates among runners. It also improves memory and cognitive function
                    by increasing the size of the hippocampus. Regular running boosts the immune system, reducing the
                    likelihood of colds and respiratory infections by nearly half. Furthermore, running is known to
                    enhance mood, concentration, and energy levels, often leading to the well-known "runner's high,"
                    contributing to an overall improved quality of life.</p>

                    Running has some drawbacks, including a higher risk of injury due to its high-impact nature. Common
                    injuries such as shin splints, knee pain, and plantar fasciitis can arise from the stress placed on
                    joints, muscles, and bones. Additionally, running demands a significant time commitment,
                    particularly for those training for races or aiming to improve fitness, which can be challenging for
                    individuals with busy schedules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other challenges include weather dependence, as outdoor runs can be disrupted by rain, snow, or
                    extreme heat, making it difficult for those in regions with unpredictable weather. Running can also
                    be mentally demanding, especially for beginners or those struggling with motivation, as pushing for
                    longer distances or faster times can be tough. Lastly, the cost of running gear, including quality
                    shoes and clothing, can add up, making it a potentially expensive activity.</p>
