                        which is the top of the upper arm bone. They keep the shoulder in its socket. The rotator cuff
                        muscles also play a role in lifting and rotating the arm. Rotator cuff injuries, especially
                        dislocations, are common.</li>

                            The shoulder press is an upper-body-focused movement that allows you to increase your
                            overhead strength. When done correctly, it can lead to a significant increase in your
                            shoulders’ size. It’s a fantastic exercise to include in your routine, whether you’re an
                            athlete, a casual lifter, or an older person looking to maintain muscle mass.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As its name indicates, the shoulder press focuses on the muscles in your shoulders and upper
                            chest. From deltoids to triceps, the shoulder press is one of the most impactful exercises
                            you can do for your shoulders.</p>

                                Face pulls use a cable machine with a rope attachment to train the rear deltoids, the
                                muscles in the back of the shoulders, with support from the traps, rhomboids and rotator
                                cuff. Strengthening these muscles can help with poor posture, improve shoulder
                                stability, and help with overall shoulder and back strength.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The most popular of shoulder movements typically include pressing and raise movements
                                which mostly work the anterior and lateral delts and neglect the rear delts. Including
                                rear delt exercises like the face pull is important for building strong, healthy
                                shoulders. It also helps to prevent muscular imbalances between the front and back of
                                your body, which can lead to poor posture like slumping.

                                    The lateral raise is a strength training isolation exercise that works the
                                    shoulders (specifically the lateral deltoids), with the trapezius (upper back)
                                    supporting by stabilising the exercise.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This exercise involves lifting weights away from your body, out to the side.
                                    It's an exercise which looks much easier than it is, and even using light
                                    weights for lateral raises can help to build strength and size. An added bonus
                                    is that lat raises can improve the range of motion in your shoulder, and help to
                                    stabilise the shoulders.
