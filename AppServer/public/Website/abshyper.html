                    <li>Rectus abdominis: This pair of muscles goes down either side of the middle of your abdomen from
                        your ribs to the front of your pelvis. They’re divided into two segments by a muscle called the
                        linea alba. Your rectus abdominis hold your internal organs in place and keep your body stable
                        during movement. The rectus abdominis may form bumps sometimes called a “six-pack” when someone
                        has a trim, fit abdomen (“abs”).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pyramidalis: This vertical muscle is small and shaped like a triangle. It’s located at the base
                        of your pubic bone. It sits in front of your rectus abdominis and attaches to your linea alba.
                        Your pyramidalis help maintain internal pressure in your abdomen. About 20% of people don’t have
                        pyramidalis muscles.

                        External obliques: Your external obliques are a pair of muscles, one on each side of your rectus
                        abdominis. They’re the largest of the flat muscles and sit at the bottom of the stack. They run
                        from the sides of your body toward the middle. Your external obliques allow your trunk to twist
                        from side to side.

                    <li>
                        Internal obliques: Your internal obliques are a pair of muscles on top of your external
                        obliques, just inside your hip bones. They’re much thinner and smaller than your external
                        obliques. Like your external obliques, they’re on the sides of your rectus abdominis, running
                        from the sides of your trunk toward the middle. They work with your external oblique muscles to
                        allow your trunk to twist and turn.
                    </li>
                    <li>Transversus abdominis: Your transversus abdominis are the deepest of the flat muscles, layered
                        on top of your internal obliques. These muscles help stabilize your trunk and maintain internal
                        abdominal pressure.</li>

                            Leg raises are an excellent exercise for targeting the lower abdominal
                            muscles. The primary goal is to lift the legs, allowing for a controlled and isolated
                            movement. This exercise
                            effectively grows the core, especially the lower abs, while minimizing strain on the
                            lower back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to engaging the core, leg raises also work the hip flexors and improve
                            overall stability and control. The padded support allows for proper alignment and reduces
                            the risk of injury. To maximize benefits, it's important to maintain proper form by keeping
                            the back straight, engaging the core throughout the movement, and lifting the legs in a
                            slow, controlled manner.</p>

                                The Russian twist is a versatile core exercise that targets the obliques and deeper core
                                muscles (also known as the transverse abdominis). This exercise involves twisting the
                                torso from side to side while sitting on the floor, often with the feet elevated and a
                                weight or medicine ball in hand for added resistance. It helps improve rotational
                                strength, stability, and overall core definition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to strengthening the obliques, the Russian twist enhances balance and
                                coordination, making it beneficial for various sports and daily activities. Proper form
                                is essential to avoid strain on the lower back, with a focus on keeping the spine
                                neutral, engaging the core throughout the movement, and performing the twists in a
                                controlled manner.

                                    The cable crunch is an effective core exercise that targets the abdominal muscles,
                                    particularly the rectus abdominis. Unlike floor crunches, the cable crunch reduces
                                    neck strain by allowing you to focus on using your abs without needing to lift your
                                    head or shoulders. It also helps improve spinal flexion, a fundamental movement for
                                    building a strong, functional core.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This exercise helps strengthen and define the core, improve posture, and enhance
                                    overall abdominal endurance. Proper form is crucial to avoid strain on the lower
                                    back and ensure maximum activation of the ab muscles.
                                </p>
