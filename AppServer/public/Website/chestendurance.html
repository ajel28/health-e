                    <li> Pectoralis major: The main muscle associated with the chest, the pectoralis major is the large
                        muscle you can see from the outside. Its main action is to bring the arms closer to the body,
                        but it also assists with moving the shoulders and rotating the arms. The pectoralis major is the
                        biggest and strongest—and therefore the most important—of the chest muscles.</li>
                    <li>Pectoralis minor: Situated beneath the pectoralis major to assist in key functions, the
                        pectoralis minor is an important chest muscle, but also a problematic one. It is integral to
                        shoulder movement, especially shoulder rotation. Situated in a sensitive area near the rib cage,
                        the pectoralis minor is prone to painful tightness, which can disrupt posture.</li>

                        serratus anterior is known as the “boxer muscle” because it enables a long and strong reach.
                    </li>

                        the clavicle bone when we breathe in. But because it’s situated in a place where some people
                        hold tension, the subclavius is prone to tightness.</li>

                            A bench press is an exercise that can be used to strengthen the muscles of the upper body,
                            including the pectorals, arms, and shoulders. Depending on your goals, there are different
                            variations of bench presses that work slightly different muscles, too. For example, a
                            narrower grip bench press will put extra emphasis on the triceps and forearms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other benefits of adding bench presses to your weight-training regimen include increasing
                            upper body strength, improving muscular endurance, and even preparing your upper body to do
                            movements like pushups. They also can be an effective strengthening exercise for sports like
                            sprinting, hockey, and football.</p>

                                The cable fly is a chest fly variation which uses the cable machine to target the
                                pectorals, with both the deltoids, triceps, and core engaged to help with stability.
                                While the arms replicate the movement of the dumbbell fly, a standing position is
                                adopted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The use of the cables can help to make the fly more challenging as the tension is
                                consistent throughout the entire movement, unlike the dumbbell variation where there is
                                little resistance at the top of the movement. The eccentric (lowering) portion is also
                                more challenging on the cable machine.

                                    The incline dumbbell press is the dumbbell variation of the barbell incline bench
                                    press and uses an incline or adjustable bench rather than an incline bench rack. The
                                    exercise involves pressing dumbbells from the chest by extending the arms up, while
                                    sitting at a 30 to 45 incline.
                                </p>

                                    Primarily targeting the chest muscles, the dumbbell incline press will activate the
                                    pectorals, triceps, and deltoids. The incline of the bench means that it targets the
                                    upper chest and deltoids more, specifically hitting the clavicular head of the pec
                                    major. This variation requires more stability and single arm strength compared to
                                    the barbell version.

                                        The pec deck machine, also known as the chest fly machine, is a machine designed
                                        to isolate the pectoral muscles. It is particularly effective for targeting the
                                        chest muscles at chest level, providing stability and safety during workouts.
                                        Using one arm on the pec deck machine can also engage the core muscles,
                                        particularly the obliques. While the pec deck machine is effective, there are
                                        other exercises that can also target the chest muscles. The pectoralis major is
                                        significantly activated during this exercise, emphasizing its importance in
                                        chest workouts. The starting position of the arms on the pec deck machine
                                        impacts muscle engagement and the overall effectiveness of the workout. </p>

                                        The pec deck works both your chest and its supporting muscles, primarily your
                                        pectoralis major, which is the muscle that allows you to swing and bring your
                                        arms together.
