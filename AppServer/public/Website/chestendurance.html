                    <li> Pectoralis major: The main muscle associated with the chest, the pectoralis major is the large
                        muscle you can see from the outside. Its main action is to bring the arms closer to the body,
                        but it also assists with moving the shoulders and rotating the arms. The pectoralis major is the
                        biggest and strongest—and therefore the most important—of the chest muscles.</li>
                    <li>Pectoralis minor: Situated beneath the pectoralis major to assist in key functions, the
                        pectoralis minor is an important chest muscle, but also a problematic one. It is integral to
                        shoulder movement, especially shoulder rotation. Situated in a sensitive area near the rib cage,
                        the pectoralis minor is prone to painful tightness, which can disrupt posture.</li>

                        serratus anterior is known as the “boxer muscle” because it enables a long and strong reach.
                    </li>
                    <li>Subclavius: Almost a forgotten muscle, the subclavius is small, triangle-shaped, and elevates
                        the clavicle bone when we breathe in. But because it’s situated in a place where some people
                        hold tension, the subclavius is prone to tightness.</li>

                           Push-ups are a fundemental exercise that can help you build a strong and stable chest from the comfort of your home. Push-ups are a simple movement which have varying levels of difficulty where you can adjust the excercise to make it easier or harder to your liking. If you want to target different areas of your chest you can move your hands and feet and change position while staying within this excercise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Other benefits of adding Push-ups to your daily activity is increased bloodflow throughout the upper body, better levels of cardio, and improve posture. Push-ups are a phenomenal excercise when it comes to building stamina and longevity in your chest.</p>

                                A weighted dip is a bodyweight strength exercise that primarily targets the upper body muscles, especially the triceps, shoulders, and chest, with the addition of weight to increase strength and stability within your chest. It involves lowering and raising your body using your arms, typically with your hands resting on parallel bars, a dip station, or even a bench or chair (for modified versions), with a weighted chain belt where you can attach different weights to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The use of the weight can help to make the dips more challenging as the tension is
                                consistent throughout the entire movement, due to the pull of the weight. Both the eccentric and concentric of the movement is affected by the gravity, helping your chest and body build itself and train under resistance.

                                    The dumbbell press is the a movement where your back is flat on the bench and extending the arms up, while. The goal of this excercise is to use a medium to light weight and go for a longer amount of repititions to build up strength and endurance for heavier lifts so you dont gas out early.

                                    Primarily targeting the chest muscles, the dumbbell press will activate the
                                    pectorals, triceps, and deltoids. The flat bench means that it targets the
                                    upper chest and deltoids more, specifically hitting the clavicular head of the pec
                                    major, also directly emphasizing the middle regions of the chest building longevity and strength in each part of the chest. This sequence requires more stability and total upper body.

                                        The pec deck machine, also known as the chest fly machine, is a machine designed
                                        to isolate the pectoral muscles. It is particularly effective for targeting the
                                        chest muscles at chest level, providing stability and safety during workouts.
                                        Using one arm on the pec deck machine can also engage the core muscles,
                                        particularly the obliques. While the pec deck machine is effective, there are
                                        other exercises that can also target the chest muscles. The pectoralis major is
                                        significantly activated during this exercise, emphasizing its importance in
                                        chest workouts. The starting position of the arms on the pec deck machine
                                        impacts muscle engagement and the overall effectiveness of the workout. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The pec deck works both your chest and its supporting muscles, primarily your
                                        pectoralis major, which is the muscle that allows you to swing and bring your
                                        arms together.
                                    </p>
