                    Soccer (or football), played by two teams of 11 players, is a game where participants aim to score
                    by maneuvering the ball into the opposing team’s goal without using their hands or arms, except for
                    the goalkeeper within the penalty area. The team with the most goals at the end wins the match. Its
                    simplicity in rules and minimal equipment requirements make football accessible and playable in
                    various environments, from formal pitches to streets and beaches.
                </p>
                <p>

                    As the world’s most popular ball game, football boasts vast global participation and viewership.
                    Governed by FIFA, the sport had around 250 million players and over 1.3 billion enthusiasts at the
                    start of the 21st century. Football’s appeal is highlighted by the massive audience for its premier
                    event, the World Cup, which for example in 2010 attracted over 26 billion viewers across the
                    tournament.</p>

                <p>
                    There are multiple workout splits a soccer player can follow. A reminder is that all of these splits
                    should be conducted with exercises that promote strength and endurance, and possibly some
                    hypertrophy in the muscles. Here are some examples:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Push; Pull; Legs/Abs - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any order), with at
                    least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.</p>
                <p>
                <p> Upper; Lower; Conditioning/Agility - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any
                    order), with at
                    least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.</p>
                <p>
                    Legs/Abs; Upper Body; Plyometrics - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any order),
                    with at least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.</p>
            </div>

        <li>Body Composition</li>
        <div class="ListFlexProgram">
            <div class="programImg" id="messiImg">
                <img src="img/Messi.png" alt="">

                <p>
                    For soccer players, the ideal body composition combines lean muscle mass with a moderate body fat
                    percentage to optimize agility, speed, and endurance. Male soccer players typically aim for a body
                    fat percentage between 6% and 15%, while female players usually target 12% to 20%. This composition
                    allows for quick, explosive movements, such as sprinting and jumping, while maintaining the
                    endurance needed to perform consistently throughout a match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muscle mass in soccer players is focused on functional strength, particularly in the lower body,
                    core, and upper body for balance, stability, and power. Strength training is essential to enhance
                    performance in areas like acceleration, tackling, and ball control. Nutrition plays a pivotal role,
                    with a focus on carbohydrates for energy, proteins for muscle repair and recovery, and fats for
                    sustained energy. A balanced diet ensures that players can maintain their energy levels and recover
                    effectively, supporting the high demands of training and competition.</p>

                    Soccer is a dynamic, fast-paced sport that offers numerous benefits for children, promoting both
                    physical fitness and essential life skills. It enhances physical stamina, endurance, agility, and
                    coordination through constant movement and repetitive practice. This helps children improve their
                    motor skills and cardiovascular health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond physical benefits, soccer encourages socialization and teamwork by requiring players to
                    collaborate effectively to achieve common goals. This helps children develop strong communication
                    skills and forge friendships across diverse backgrounds. The sport also sharpens focus and
                    concentration, as players must quickly interpret physical and social cues to make strategic
                    decisions. Lastly, soccer nurtures responsibility by teaching kids time management, discipline, and
                    the importance of preparation, skills that are invaluable as they grow and face more complex
                    schedules and responsibilities.</p>

                    Soccer is a physically demanding sport with a significant risk of injuries such as sprains,
                    fractures, and concussions. Collisions, falls, and overexertion are common, and the injury rate can
                    be high, as shown by NCAA studies. Over time, players may also face long-term health issues,
                    including neurological concerns like dementia or depression, potentially linked to repeated head
                    impacts. These health risks can have lasting effects on a player's quality of life and career
                    longevity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The collaborative nature of soccer can sometimes lead to conflicts and tension within teams,
                    affecting morale and performance. Disagreements among teammates can escalate, highlighting the
                    challenges of maintaining a cohesive unit. Additionally, pursuing a professional soccer career
                    demands rigorous physical conditioning and a strict lifestyle. Players must adhere to continuous
                    training and dietary regimens, and even minor injuries can jeopardize their ability to compete at
                    the highest levels. This intense commitment can be both physically and mentally taxing.</p>
