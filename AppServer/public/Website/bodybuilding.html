                    Bodybuilding, a regimen of exercises designed to enhance the human body’s muscular development and
                    promote general health and fitness. As a competitive activity, bodybuilding aims to display in
                    artistic fashion pronounced muscle mass, symmetry, and definition for overall aesthetic effect.
                    Barbells, dumbbells, and other resistance training devices are used in the exercises. For the use of
                    similar exercises for sports training and conditioning, general conditioning, and rehabilitation
                    therapy, see weight training.

                <p>
                    Bodybuilding by the ancient Greeks served as the origin and inspiration for its practice by most
                    later societies. Modern competitions grew largely out of European strongman theatrical and circus
                    acts of the late 19th century. </p>

                    There are multiple workout splits a bodybuilder can follow. A reminder is that all of these splits
                    should be conducted with exercises that promote hypertrophy in the muscles. Here are some examples:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Push; Pull; Legs/Abs - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any order), with at
                    least one day of rest in between every cycle.</p>
                <p>
                    Chest/Biceps/Triceps; Back/Forearms/Shoulders; Legs/Abs - These days should follow each other
                    concurrently (in any order), with at least one day of rest in between every cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Chest; Back; Arms; Legs; Abs (Bro Split) - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any
                    order), with at least one day of rest in between every cycle.

                    Bodybuilders aim for a body composition that maximizes muscle mass while minimizing body fat. The
                    ideal body fat percentage for male bodybuilders typically ranges from 6% to 10%, while for female
                    bodybuilders, it's generally between 10% and 20%. This low body fat level enhances muscle
                    definition, making muscles appear more prominent and aesthetically pleasing on stage. The most
                    important thing to note is to be careful about your health. NEVER get to a body fat so low it
                    hinders your quality of life to a great extent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muscle mass is equally crucial, as it's the primary factor judged in bodybuilding competitions.
                    Building significant muscle mass involves progressive overload. Together, these elements contribute
                    to the ideal body composition that bodybuilders strive for, balancing aesthetics with physical
                    performance.</p>

                    Bodybuilding, is great to improve overall health and
                    fitness. This type of exercise also enhances muscular endurance, and maximum
                    strength along with hypertrophy, while also improving flexibility, balance, posture, and
                    coordination. Techniques like circuit training and explosive power training help boost endurance and
                    power, making it beneficial
                    for both general fitness and athletic performance.

                    Bodybuilding offers numerous health benefits beyond muscle growth. It helps slow age-related muscle
                    loss, increases calorie burning throughout the day, and enhances bone density, reducing the risk of
                    fractures. Additionally, it improves mental health by boosting mood, self-confidence, sleep
                    quality, and also discipline. Bodybuilding also strengthens the immune system, supports
                    cardiovascular health, and
                    reduces injury risks, making it a catalyst of a healthy lifestyle.</p>

                    Bodybuilding at the professional level often involves pushing the body to its physical limits, with
                    many athletes relying on anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to achieve massive,
                    sculpted physiques. This reliance on drugs can lead to a host of negative health consequences,
                    including hormonal imbalances, cardiovascular issues like enlarged hearts and high blood pressure,
                    and damage to the liver and kidneys. The use of diuretics to shed water weight before competitions
                    is particularly dangerous, sometimes resulting in life-threatening electrolyte imbalances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the physical toll, the psychological effects of steroid abuse are significant. Users may
                    experience aggression, mood disorders, and dependence on these drugs, driven by body image issues
                    such as muscle dysmorphia. The withdrawal from steroids can be equally challenging, leading to depression, fatigue, and
                    loss of sexual function. This relentless pursuit
                    of an idealized physique often comes at the expense of long-term health and well-being, with some
                    users facing irreversible damage to their hearts, reproductive systems, and mental health. While you may not be so invested in bodybuilding, moderation is the key to have a healthy and productive lifestyle.</p>
