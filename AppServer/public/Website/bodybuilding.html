                        Bodybuilding, a regimen of exercises designed to enhance the human body’s muscular development and promote general health and fitness. As a competitive activity, bodybuilding aims to display in artistic fashion pronounced muscle mass, symmetry, and definition for overall aesthetic effect. Barbells, dumbbells, and other resistance training devices are used in the exercises. For the use of similar exercises for sports training and conditioning, general conditioning, and rehabilitation therapy, see weight training.

                        Bodybuilding by the ancient Greeks served as the origin and inspiration for its practice by most later societies. Modern competitions grew largely out of European strongman theatrical and circus acts of the late 19th century. </p>

                                A weighted dip is a bodyweight strength exercise that primarily targets the upper body muscles, especially the triceps, shoulders, and chest, with the addition of weight to increase strength and stability within your chest. It involves lowering and raising your body using your arms, typically with your hands resting on parallel bars, a dip station, or even a bench or chair (for modified versions), with a weighted chain belt where you can attach different weights to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The use of the weight can help to make the dips more challenging as the tension is
                                consistent throughout the entire movement, due to the pull of the weight. Both the eccentric and concentric of the movement is affected by the gravity, helping your chest and body build itself and train under resistance.

                                    The dumbbell press is the a movement where your back is flat on the bench and extending the arms up, while. The goal of this excercise is to use a medium to light weight and go for a longer amount of repititions to build up strength and endurance for heavier lifts so you dont gas out early.

                                    Primarily targeting the chest muscles, the dumbbell press will activate the
                                    pectorals, triceps, and deltoids. The flat bench means that it targets the
                                    upper chest and deltoids more, specifically hitting the clavicular head of the pec
                                    major, also directly emphasizing the middle regions of the chest building longevity and strength in each part of the chest. This sequence requires more stability and total upper body.

                                        The pec deck machine, also known as the chest fly machine, is a machine designed
                                        to isolate the pectoral muscles. It is particularly effective for targeting the
                                        chest muscles at chest level, providing stability and safety during workouts.
                                        Using one arm on the pec deck machine can also engage the core muscles,
                                        particularly the obliques. While the pec deck machine is effective, there are
                                        other exercises that can also target the chest muscles. The pectoralis major is
                                        significantly activated during this exercise, emphasizing its importance in
                                        chest workouts. The starting position of the arms on the pec deck machine
                                        impacts muscle engagement and the overall effectiveness of the workout. </p>

                                        The pec deck works both your chest and its supporting muscles, primarily your
                                        pectoralis major, which is the muscle that allows you to swing and bring your
                                        arms together.
