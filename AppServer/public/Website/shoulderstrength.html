                        which is the top of the upper arm bone. They keep the shoulder in its socket. The rotator cuff
                        muscles also play a role in lifting and rotating the arm. Rotator cuff injuries, especially
                        dislocations, are common.</li>

                            The barbell shoulder press targets the deltoids and trapezius, along with the smaller,
                            deeper muscles that make up your shoulders. You’ll also engage your triceps, biceps, back,
                            and core for greater body strength. The simplicity of the barbell shoulder press makes it a
                            good exercise for people of all fitness levels.</p>
                        <p>
                            Because the barbell shoulder press strengthens your upper body and core, it may help improve
                            your posture. Improved posture can translate into reduced aches and pains, especially in
                            the back and neck.</p>

                                The rear delt fly is a dumbbell exercise which involves sweeping the dumbbell out to the
                                side to train the rear deltoids. In addition to the rear delts, this exercise works the
                                traps, rhomdoids, lateral deltoids, and core.</p>

                            <p>The use of free weights means rear delt flyes are great for improving both strength and
                                stability in the shoulders. It can also help to identify and minimise muscular
                                imbalances as each arm must lift the exact same load. Working the rear delts can help to
                                improve poor posture and reduce imbalances between the front of the body and back, which
                                can often occur in people who spend a lot of their day slouched or hunched forward.</p>

                            <p>Rear delt flyes can be done seated or standing
                            </p>

                                    The lateral raise is a strength training isolation exercise that works the
                                    shoulders (specifically the lateral deltoids), with the trapezius (upper back)
                                    supporting by stabilising the exercise.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This exercise involves lifting weights away from your body, out to the side.
                                    It's an exercise which looks much easier than it is, and even using light
                                    weights for lateral raises can help to build strength and size. An added bonus
                                    is that lat raises can improve the range of motion in your shoulder, and help to
                                    stabilise the shoulders.
