                <p>
                    Basketball is a competitive team sport where two teams of five players aim to score points by
                    shooting a basketball through the opponent's hoop, which is mounted 10 feet high. Points are awarded
                    for field goals, worth two points, or three if shot from beyond the three-point line. Free throws,
                    awarded after fouls, are worth one point each. The team with the most points at the end of the game
                    wins, with overtime played if the score is tied. Players advance the ball by dribbling or passing,
                    employing various offensive moves like layups, jump shots, and dunks, while defensive actions
                    include stealing, intercepting, and blocking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each team’s five players take on specific roles: the center, power forward, small forward, shooting
                    guard, and point guard, with roles defined by height, strength, and skill. The point guard typically
                    orchestrates the team's plays, managing offensive and defensive strategies. Violations such as
                    traveling, double dribbling, or carrying the ball are penalized. Besides the formal five-on-five
                    game, basketball can also be played informally in smaller team sizes.</p>

        <li>Workout Split</li>

                <p>
                    There are multiple workout splits a basketball player can follow. A reminder is that all of these
                    splits
                    should be conducted with exercises that all promote strength and endurance, and hypertrophy in the
                    muscles. Here are some examples:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Push; Pull; Legs/Abs - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any order), with at
                    least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.</p>
                <p>
                <p> Upper; Lower; Conditioning/Agility - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any
                    order), with at
                    least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.</p>
                <p>
                    Legs/Abs; Upper Body; Plyometrics - These days should follow each other concurrently (in any order),
                    with at least one-two days of rest in between every cycle.</p>

        <li>Body Composition</li>
        <div class="ListFlexProgram">
            <div class="programImg" id="kawhiImg">
                <img src="img/Kawhi.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="TextProgram" id="kawhiProgram">
                <p>
                    For basketball players, the ideal body composition emphasizes lean muscle mass combined with a
                    moderate body fat percentage to maximize agility, speed, and endurance on the court. Male players
                    typically aim for a body fat percentage between 6% and 12%, while female players generally target
                    15% to 20%. This composition supports explosive movements like jumping, sprinting, and quick
                    directional changes, essential for both offensive and defensive play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Muscle mass is crucial for basketball players, focusing on functional strength in the legs, core,
                    and upper body. Strong legs and a solid core enhance jumping ability, balance, and agility, while
                    upper body strength improves shooting, passing, and physical resilience. Strength training is a key
                    component of a basketball player's regimen, aimed at enhancing power and reducing injury risk.
                    Nutrition is vital, with an emphasis on carbohydrates for energy, proteins for muscle repair, and
                    fats for sustained performance. A well-rounded diet ensures players have the energy and recovery
                    capacity to endure the fast-paced nature of basketball games and practices.</p>

                    Basketball improves muscular endurance, coordination, and balance through high-intensity movements,
                    strengthening both upper and lower body muscles. It also promotes bone health, with research showing
                    team sports like basketball increasing bone mineral density. The sport helps develop motor skills,
                    stamina, and agility while supporting healthy body composition by reducing body fat and boosting
                    lean mass. Additionally, regular play enhances cardiovascular fitness, benefiting overall heart
                    health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basketball builds self-confidence and reduces stress by releasing endorphins, improving mood, and
                    fostering relaxation. It also encourages effective communication and teamwork, allowing players to
                    connect with others from diverse backgrounds. The team environment supports personal growth, helping
                    players develop social skills, empathy, and a strong sense of community.</p>

                <p>
                    Basketball, like many sports, carries a risk of injury due to jumping, sudden direction changes, and
                    physical contact. Common injuries include sprained ankles, knee issues, and collisions. While these
                    risks are inherent, they can be minimized with proper training, warm-ups, and safety practices. The
                    fast-paced nature of the game can also be physically demanding, especially for individuals with
                    certain health conditions or limited physical ability. However, basketball can be adapted to various
                    skill levels and played at a less intense pace to suit different players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finding suitable times for basketball can be a challenge, particularly in areas where the sport is
                    very popular. Courts may be in high demand, with limited availability during peak hours. To overcome
                    this, players may need to plan ahead, be flexible with timings, or seek out less crowded facilities
                    for practice or casual play.</p>
