                <ul>
                    <li>Gluteus maximus: You’re probably familiar with this one. It’s the largest muscle in the upper
                        leg, located at the back of the hip, in the glutes (your butt). One of the strongest muscles in
                        the body, the gluteus maximus can generate a large amount of force. It controls motion at the
                        pelvis and plays a role in maintaining posture. It’s one of the muscles you use to climb a
                        flight of stairs or to go rock climbing, for example.
                    </li>
                    <li>Gluteus medius: Also located at the hip, just above the gluteus maximus, the gluteus medius
                        helps with stability of the pelvis and hip abduction, which is the side movement of the leg away
                        from the body. The gluteus medius prevents the opposite side of the pelvis from drooping during
                        walking and running.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Iliopsoas: This is a combined term for two of the largest hip flexor muscles, the psoas and the
                        iliacus. Both are connected to the thigh bone, with the psoas originating at the low back and
                        the iliacus on the inside of the pelvis. These muscles help with posture and engage every time
                        we take a step forward. The iliopsoas is known for being a tight muscle from sedentary
                        lifestyles.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius: These four muscles
                        make up what is commonly known as the quadriceps (quad equals four) and are located on the front
                        of the leg. They attach to the patella (kneecap) and the tibia (shin) bones and work together to
                        straighten the knee in activities such as kicking, jumping, squatting, and cycling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris: The three muscles of the hamstrings, in the
                        back of the leg, bend your knees and move your hips backward and are important for decelerating
                        (slowing down) when running. Hamstrings are also particularly prone to strains and tendonitis.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/03/100103-050-64EC17A7/view-leg-hip-muscles-thigh.jpg" alt="">
                <ul>
                    <li>Tibialis anterior: Located on the outside of the shin bone, the tibialis anterior is the main
                        muscle used to raise the front of your foot upward toward your shin. It also controls the
                        lowering of your foot to the floor during walking. Paralysis or weakness in this muscle can lead
                        to foot drop.
                    </li>
                    <li>Gastrocnemius and soleus: These calf muscles, on the back of the leg, both link into the
                        Achilles tendon, the body’s strongest tendon, which can withstand a force up to 10 times your
                        body weight. The gastrocnemius is a powerful calf muscle that works with the hamstrings to bend
                        the knee and propel us forward when walking, running, and jumping. Located behind it is the
                        soleus, which controls plantar flexing your foot, such as when pressing on the gas pedal while
                        driving. The soleus is important for good posture to prevent us from falling forward.</li>
                    <li>
                        Posterior tibialis: Situated deep in the lower leg, the posterior tibialis is an important but
                        often forgotten muscle that is key to stabilizing the arch of the foot. Posterior tibialis
                        tendon dysfunction is a common cause of acquired flat foot deformity.

                            The squat is a body resistance exercise that works the leg muscles. Specifically, the squat
                            targets the quadriceps and the hamstring muscles. Strengthening these muscles can help
                            protect your knees and boost your performance in a variety of sports.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition to targeting the legs, squats engage the glutes, core, and lower back muscles,
                            making them a highly effective compound movement for overall strength and stability.
                            Regularly performing squats can improve your balance, posture, and functional fitness, as
                            they mimic natural movements like sitting and standing. Whether you’re an athlete or simply
                            looking to enhance daily mobility, squats are a versatile exercise that can be adapted to
                            your fitness level and goals.</p>

                                The Bulgarian split squat is a version of a single-leg squat where the back leg is
                                elevated on a bench or a sturdy chair. As a unilateral squat, the exercise focuses more
                                on the quadriceps than similar lower-body compound movements. It also requires a lot of
                                balance and coordination, increasing the core and upper body engagement required to
                                maintain proper form.
                            </p>

                                The Bulgarian split squat is a great movement to add to a lower-body strength or
                                total-body workout routine. Due to the compound, balance-focused nature of the movement,
                                it's a good idea to include it toward the beginning of a workout, perhaps after a solid
                                warmup including traditional squats, Romanian deadlifts, or barbell snatches.2 If you're
                                ready to fire up your quads and grow your glutes, read on for ways to try the
                                highly-effective exercise.

                                    A calf raise is a simple yet effective exercise that targets the muscles of the
                                    lower leg, primarily the gastrocnemius and soleus. This movement involves lifting
                                    your heels off the ground to stand on the balls of your feet, creating a contraction
                                    in the calves. Calf raises can be performed with body weight, dumbbells, or a
                                    barbell for added resistance, and they can be done on flat ground or a raised
                                    platform for a deeper stretch.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Calf raises are particularly beneficial for hypertrophy, as they isolate the calf
                                    muscles and allow for focused muscle activation. By using progressive
                                    overload—gradually increasing weight or repetitions—you can effectively stimulate
                                    growth in both the gastrocnemius and soleus. Performing variations such as seated or
                                    standing calf raises targets different parts of the calf, promoting balanced muscle
                                    development. Controlled movements and emphasizing the stretch at the bottom and
                                    contraction at the top of each rep can further maximize hypertrophic gains, helping
                                    you build strong, well-defined calves.

                                        The Deadlift is one of the most functional and basic exercises there is. The
                                        goal of the exercise is to bend down, grab an object on the floor, and lift it
                                        off the ground. Improvements in strength and speed can be attained from the
                                        deadlift, which translate to an increase in overall power and athletic
                                        performance.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        In addition to enhancing strength, the deadlift engages multiple muscle groups,
                                        including the glutes, hamstrings, lower back, and core, making it an efficient
                                        full-body workout. It also helps improve posture and stability by reinforcing
                                        proper body mechanics. Proper form is crucial to avoid injury and maximize
                                        benefits, with a focus on maintaining a neutral spine, engaging the core, and
                                        using controlled movements throughout the lift.
