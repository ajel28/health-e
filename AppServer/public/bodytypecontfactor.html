                    <p>
                        Metabolism refers to all the chemical processes going on continuously inside your body that
                        allow life and normal functioning (maintaining normal functioning in the body is called
                        homeostasis). These processes include those that break down nutrients from our food, and those
                        that build and repair our body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Metabolism regulates:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Breathing</li>
                        <li>Circulating blood</li>
                        <li>Digesting food</li>
                        <li>Growing and repairing cells.</li>
                        <li>Managing hormone levels</li>
                        <li>Regulating body temperature</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Your metabolic rate is influenced by many factors – including age, gender, muscle-to-fat ratio,
                        amount of physical activity and hormone function.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Amount of body fat – fat cells are ‘sluggish’ and burn far fewer kilojoules than most other
                            tissues and organs of the body.</li>
                        <li>Crash dieting, starving or fasting – eating too few kilojoules encourages the body to slow
                            the metabolism to conserve energy. Metabolism can drop by up to 15% and if lean muscle
                            tissue is
                            also lost, this further reduces metabolism.</li>
                        <li>Age – metabolism slows with age due to loss of muscle tissue, but also due to hormonal and
                            neurological changes.</li>
                        <li>Gender – generally, men have faster metabolisms because they tend to be larger.</li>
                        <li>Genetic predisposition – your metabolic rate may be partly decided by your genes.</li>
                        <li>Hormonal and nervous controls – metabolism is controlled by the nervous and hormonal
                            systems.
                            Hormonal imbalances can influence how quickly or slowly the body burns kilojoules.</li>
                        <li>Infection or illness – metabolism increases because the body has to work harder to build new
                            tissues
                            and to create an immune response.</li>
                        <li>Amount of physical activity – hard-working muscles need plenty of energy to burn. Regular
                            exercise increases muscle mass and teaches the body to burn kilojoules at a faster rate,
                            even
                            when at rest.</li>

            <li>Muscle Insertions</li>
            <div class="ListFlexMI">
                <div class="ListText">
                    <p>Muscle insertions are determined entirely by genetics. These insertions refer to the points where
                        muscles attach to bones and act as anchor points during contraction. While muscle insertions
                        generally don’t impact strength, they can significantly influence how a muscle appears.</p>
                    <p>For example, a "disconnected chest" insertion might be considered less desirable compared to
                        other chest insertions. On the other hand, aesthetics in areas like the biceps often come down
                        to personal preference.</p>
                    <p>It’s important to note that muscle insertions cannot be changed, no matter how much you train.
                        However, what does make a difference is filling out your frame through consistent exercise.
                        Building muscle and achieving a balanced physique is far more important than worrying about
                        genetic features you can’t control.</p>

                <div class="ListText">
                    <p>Taller individuals have longer lever arms (e.g., limbs), which can affect the mechanics of
                        lifting weights. This can sometimes make lifting heavier weights more challenging due to
                        increased torque requirements (range of motion).</p>
                    <p>While taller individuals may have more total muscle mass potential, this mass is distributed over
                        a larger frame, which can impact overall strength perception and performance in certain lifts.
                    </p>
                    <img class="heightImg" src="/Website/img/Height.png" alt="">
                    <p>Shorter limbs mean shorter lever arms, which can make lifting weights mechanically easier and
                        more efficient. This can lead to better lifting performance and potentially more effective
                        muscle stimulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Muscle gains are often more noticeable on shorter individuals because the muscle mass is
                        concentrated over a smaller area, making hypertrophy more apparent.</p>
                    <p>Overall, both height levels have their own advantages and disadvantages, but you height does not
                        determine your ability to build muscle.</p>

                <div class="ListText">
                    <p>When you start to view health and fitness as a lifestyle rather than a part-time hobby or 30-day
                        challenge, you develop behaviors that will improve many areas of your life.</p>

                    <p>Living a healthy lifestyle can inspire creativity and teach you discipline, adaptability, and
                        balance.This will not only leave you looking and feeling better, but you will show up as a
                        better version of yourself for the people in your life that truly matter.</p>

                    <p>Health and fitness are about more than the way
                        you look, the food you eat, or the weight you lift at the gym. They're about how you feel and
                        your quality of life. When you’re truly healthy, you are in a better mood and can physically do
                        more. Remember, do not focus on other people, strive to be a better version of yourself than you
                        were before.</p>
