                    Wrestling is a sport where two people try to gain control over each other using different moves and techniques, usually by pinning their opponent to the mat. There are different styles, like freestyle, where you can use your whole body, and Greco-Roman, which only allows upper body moves. The goal is to outmaneuver your opponent through strength, skill, and strategy, earning points or a pin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wrestling has been around for thousands of years and is practiced in schools, clubs, and at professional levels. It’s not only about physical strength, but also about mental toughness, focus, and discipline. Wrestlers train hard to build endurance and learn techniques, and the sport teaches respect and perseverance, both on and off the mat.</p>

                <p> There are several workout splits a wrestler can follow to improve strength, endurance, and agility. It’s important to ensure that each training session focuses on enhancing these attributes, while also promoting recovery. Here are some examples: 
                </p> 
                <p> Strength; Technique; Conditioning - These days should follow each other consecutively (in any order), with at least one to two days of rest in between each cycle.
                 </p>
                 <p> Wrestling Technique; Core/Balance; Flexibility - These days should follow each other consecutively (in any order), with at least one to two days of rest in between each cycle. 
                 </p> 
                 <p> Strength & Conditioning; Mobility/Flexibility; Agility - These days should follow each other consecutively (in any order), with at least one to two days of rest in between each cycle.

        <li>Body Composition</li>

                <p>
                    Body composition for wrestlers is crucial because it directly impacts performance, strength, and endurance. Wrestlers often aim for a lean, muscular physique with low body fat to maximize agility and strength without carrying excess weight. This allows them to move quickly, maintain control, and be more efficient in their techniques. A strong, balanced body helps them perform better in various aspects of the sport, from takedowns to escapes and pinning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve the ideal body composition, wrestlers focus on a combination of strength training, conditioning, and proper nutrition. Building muscle through resistance exercises helps improve overall power, while conditioning ensures they have the stamina to compete at a high level. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs supports muscle growth and fat loss, while hydration and recovery are key for optimal performance. Proper body composition helps wrestlers stay competitive and avoid weight-related issues in their weight class.</p>

                <p>
                    Wrestling is a full-body workout that improves both strength and cardiovascular health. The sport involves constant movement, requiring explosive power, endurance, and flexibility. Wrestlers train their whole body—building muscle in the legs, core, and upper body—while also improving stamina through high-intensity training. This makes it an excellent way to increase overall fitness, burn calories, and build lean muscle, contributing to long-term health benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to physical fitness, wrestling enhances mental toughness, discipline, and focus. Wrestlers must stay mentally sharp, strategizing during matches and training, which also helps build resilience. The sport teaches the importance of goal-setting and persistence, as wrestlers constantly work to improve their technique and strength. This combination of physical and mental benefits helps wrestlers lead healthier, more balanced lives, both inside and outside the sport.</p>

                    One downside of wrestling is the risk of injury. Due to the physical nature of the sport, wrestlers are prone to joint injuries, strains, and sprains. Common injuries include knee, shoulder, and neck problems, which can occur during takedowns or when putting pressure on an opponent. While proper training, technique, and conditioning can reduce the risk, injuries are still an inherent part of the sport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another potential downside is the intense weight management involved in wrestling. Wrestlers often need to maintain a certain weight class, which can lead to unhealthy weight-cutting practices, such as dehydration or extreme dieting. This can negatively impact overall health, causing fatigue, dehydration, or even long-term issues with metabolism. While many wrestlers take a disciplined approach to weight management, the pressure to make weight can sometimes lead to harmful habits that affect both physical and mental well-being.</p>
