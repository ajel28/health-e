                        Genetics, genetics, genetics! It's common to see a friend making rapid progress at the gym and
                        feel demotivated if you're not seeing the same results. But here's the truth: while genetics can
                        play a role in your muscle-building journey, they don't have the final say. Your genetics may
                        influence factors like muscle insertions, body type, or natural strength, but how you develop
                        your physique is largely in your control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Studies show that while genetic factors like muscle fiber composition or hormone levels can
                        impact performance, the key drivers of progress are still training intensity, recovery, and
                        nutrition. Research highlights that individuals who consistently follow a well-structured
                        training program and eat adequately to support muscle growth see similar gains over time,
                        regardless of their genetic makeup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blaming genetics for slow progress can actually hold you back. Consistency, patience, and a
                        willingness to
                        adapt will ultimately lead to results that speak for themselves.</p>

                    <p>In the 1940s, psychologist William H. Sheldon introduced the concept of different body types, or
                        somatotypes.</p>
                    <p>Per this classification, there are three different body types:
                    <p>Ectomorph: This is when the body is lean and slender and tends to have less body fat and muscle.
                        People with this body type can often find it challenging to gain weight in the form of muscle or
                        fat. Fashion models are an example of this body type.</p>
                    <p>Endomorph: This is when the body has more stored fat, lots of muscle, and gains weight easily.
                        People with this body type are not always overweight. Football lineman and Marilyn Monroe are
                        examples of this body type.</p>
                    <p> Mesomorph: This is when the body is athletic and strong. People with this body type are neither
                        overweight nor underweight. Swimmers and volleyball players are examples of this body type.</p>
                    <p>However, these bodytypes are quite outdated, and should be taken with a grain of salt. There is
                        no 3 body types that can accurately classify 8 billion people. By restricting us to fixed types,
                        it limits our perception of what we can achieve.</p>

                    <p>Many people believe that you must be sore the next day in order to indicate a good workout.
                        However, this is not necessarily the case, especially for experienced lifters. You can still
                        have a great workout and not be sore the next day.</p>
                    <p>Soreness is NOT synonomous with muscle growth, and to certain extremes, can inhibit it. Excessive
                        exercise can lead to rhabdomyolysis, or a breakdown of the muscles in your body. Remember,
                        moderation is key.</p>

                    <p>Many people focus on the number on the scale, but it is not the best representation of body
                        changes.
                        The number on the scale is a factor of many things such as how much water you've drank, what you
                        ate
                        and what time you're weighing in.

                    <p>Often when a person loses a significant amount of weight, the number on the scale goes up because
                        of
                        building muscle from exercise.</p>

                    <p>If you want to accurately track your weight loss and muscle development, we recommend recording
                        measurements of arms, waist and thighs. And if you're going to use the scale, weigh in at the
                        same
                        time every day.</p>
