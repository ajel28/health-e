                        Body mass index (BMI) is a medical screening tool that measures the ratio of your height to your
                        weight to estimate the amount of body fat you have. Healthcare providers calculate BMI by using
                        weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of height in meters (m2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In most people, BMI correlates to body fat — the higher the number, the more body fat you may
                        have — but it’s not accurate in some cases. BMI alone does not diagnose health. Healthcare
                        providers use BMI and other tools and tests to assess someone’s health status and risks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should not use the standard BMI chart to evaluate a child’s or teenager’s weight</p>

                    <p>Body fat percentage measures the proportion of fat in your body relative to your overall weight.
                        While BMI provides a general health indicator, body fat percentage offers a more precise
                        assessment of body composition.</p>

                    <p>Physiologically, women require higher essential body fat than men for overall health. Factors
                        such as age and sex also influence an individual’s ideal body fat percentage. For most males, a
                        healthy range typically falls between 14-20% and females 20-30%, depending on these variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are various methods to measure body fat, but even the most advanced techniques come with
                        significant margins of error.</p>

                    <p>Taking body measurements is an optimal way to track weight progress because you get an idea of
                        what's really happening with your body. Knowing how to take body measurements is a valuable tool
                        if you're trying to change your body composition by losing fat and/or adding muscle. You should
                        take body measurements every 2-4 weeks.</p>
                    <p>For the most consistent results, there are some things to ensure you are doing when taking body
                        measurements. You should either wear fitted clothing or no clothing at all so that the garments
                        do not factor into the measurements. When taking body measurements yourself, stand tall with
                        your feet together, and stay relaxed without tensing, flexing, or sucking in your stomach.</p>
                    <p>Your body loses fat all over, but the areas that hold excess fat take longer. The bottom line is,
                        you can't control where the fat comes off, but you can look at your own body type and that of
                        your parents and get a decent idea of where you tend to store more fat and where you don't.</p>
                    <p>Important areas of the body to measure are your abs, arms, calves, chest, hips, thighs, and waist</p>
