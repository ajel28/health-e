                        Heredity is the process by which parents pass on their genes to their offspring. The set of
                        genes that an offspring inherits from both parents, a combination of the genetic material of
                        each, is called the organism’s genotype. The genotype is contrasted to the phenotype, which is
                        the organism’s outward appearance and the developmental outcome of its genes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One copy of your chromosome is inherited from their mother (via the egg) and the other from
                        their father (via the sperm). A sperm and an egg each contain one set of 23 chromosomes. When
                        the sperm fertilises the egg, two copies of each chromosome are present (and therefore two
                        copies of each gene), and so an embryo forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most common interaction between alleles (which are found on chromosomes) is a
                        dominant/recessive relationship. An allele of a gene is said to be dominant when it effectively
                        overrules the other (recessive) allele.</p>
                    <p>Essentially, genes are the blueprint for our bodies. They order our bodily functions, and are
                        what make you, you!</p>

                    <p>Most genes contain the information needed to make functional molecules called proteins. The
                        journey from gene to protein is complex and tightly controlled within each cell. It consists of
                        two major steps: transcription and translation.</p>
                    <p>Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They are
                        necessary for building the structural components of the human body, such as muscles and organs.
                        Proteins also determine how the organism looks, how well its body metabolises food or fights
                        infection and sometimes even how it behaves. Proteins are chains of chemical building blocks
                        called amino acids. A protein may contain a few amino acids or it could have several thousands
                    </p>
                    <p>Sometimes, gene variants (also known as mutations) prevent one or more proteins from working
                        properly. By changing a gene’s instructions for making a protein, a variant can cause a protein
                        to malfunction or to not be produced at all.</p>

                    <p>One of the proteins produced by the human body is myostatin.</p>
                    <p>Myostatin is a protein naturally produced by the human body that regulates skeletal muscle growth. By inhibiting muscle fiber size and number, myostatin plays a key role in controlling muscle mass across various species, from fish to humans. A deficiency in myostatin can lead to significant muscle overgrowth, which has made it a promising target for treating muscle-wasting disorders.</p>
                    <p>Genetics, including variations in myostatin levels, can partly explain why some individuals respond better to exercise than others. However, it’s important to remember that regardless of genetic factors, everyone has the potential to build an impressive physique with dedication and hard work.</p>
