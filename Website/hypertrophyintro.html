    <h1 class="mainMuscleGroups">Main Muscle Groups</h1>


    <p class="hypertrophyIntro">Welcome to our comprehensive guide to the body's major muscle groups! Here, you'll discover everything you need to efficiently build muscle and maximize your growth in the shortest time possible.</p>

    <main class="mainHypertrophy">
        <div class="firstRow">
            <div class="chest">
                <p>Chest</p>
                <p>The chest muscles are responsible for moving the arms across the body and up and down, in addition to
                    moving the arms. They also enable you to use your arms to push.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="shoulders">
                <p>Shoulders</p>
                <p>The shoulder muscles serve a variety of functions, including
                    holding the bones of your shoulder joint in place,
                    moving your arms up, down, forward and backward,
                    protecting your shoulder joint, and
                    rotating your shoulder joint.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="triceps">
                <p>Triceps</p>
                <p>The triceps muscle is a main muscle of the upper arm, running from the top of the shoulder to the
                    elbow at the back of the arm. When the triceps muscle contracts (shortens or tightens), it causes
                    the elbow to straighten.</p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <div class="secondRow">
            <div class="traps">
                <p>Traps</p>
                <p>The trap is a muscle in the upper back. It stabilizes the shoulders and enables the neck to move.
                    Certain stretches can help ease pain and keep movement flexible.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="back">
                <p>Back</p>
                <p>Your back has many different muscles. Some support your spine and trunk (your midsection or torso).
                    Others help you stand up, maintain your posture and help you move. Some even help you breathe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="biceps">
                <p>Biceps</p>
                <p>The bicep is a muscle situated on the front of the upper arm between the shoulder and the elbow. The
                    muscle's primary function is to flex the elbow and rotate the forearm</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="thirdRow">
            <div class="forearms">
                <p>Forearms</p>
                <p>The 20 muscles in your forearms help you make complex movements with your arms, hands, and fingers. They also play an important part in grip strength. Keeping them strong can help you with strength training as well as activities of daily life. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="legs">
                <p>Legs</p>
                <p>Your legs support your weight and stabilize your body so you can stand up straight. The muscles in your upper leg include your quadriceps and hamstrings. Your calf muscles work with other muscles of the lower leg to help you move your feet.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="abdominals">
                <p>Abs</p>
                <p>Your abdominal muscles surround your trunk between the rib cage and pelvis and keep your abdominal organs safe. Your core abdominal muscles also support your trunk and allow movements while keeping your body stable and balanced.</p>
